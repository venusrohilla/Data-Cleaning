# MBTA Ridership Data
##### upload mbta data.xlsx 
```{r}
library(readxl)
mbta <-read_xlsx("mbta data.xlsx",skip=1) 
```
```{r}
str(mbta)
```
![put str mbta part1,2](https://github.com/venusrohilla/Data-Cleaning/blob/master/Ticket%20Sales/plots/str%20mtba.PNG)
![put](https://github.com/venusrohilla/Data-Cleaning/blob/master/Ticket%20Sales/plots/str%20mtba%20part1.PNG)
![put](https://github.com/venusrohilla/Data-Cleaning/blob/master/Ticket%20Sales/plots/str%20mbta%20part2.PNG)
```{r}
summary(mbta)
```
![put summary mbta part 1,2](https://github.com/venusrohilla/Data-Cleaning/blob/master/Ticket%20Sales/plots/summary%20mbta%20part1.PNG)

#### Removing unnecessry rows and columns
Some of these rows are from analysis mixed in with the data in the excel sheet
This is super common in excel but makes the data messy and less usable
The first column is just the row number.
Remove first row because it contains many na values ,and seventh row because it has negative values, and eleventh row which contains total  of mbta.

```{r}
keep <- !(mbta$mode %in% c('All Modes by Qtr', 'Pct Chg / Yr', 'TOTAL'))
keep
mbta2 <- mbta[keep,]
glimpse(mbta2)
```
![put glimpse mbta part1,2](https://github.com/venusrohilla/Data-Cleaning/blob/master/Ticket%20Sales/plots/glimpse%20mbta2.PNG)
![put](https://github.com/venusrohilla/Data-Cleaning/blob/master/Ticket%20Sales/plots/glimpse%20mbta2%20part1.PNG)
![put](https://github.com/venusrohilla/Data-Cleaning/blob/master/Ticket%20Sales/plots/glimpse%20mbta2%20part2.PNG)

Now we have 8 observations but earlier we had 11 observations.

#### Remove the first column of mbta2
```{r}
mbta3 <- mbta2[,-1]
glimpse(mbta3)
```
Observations are stored in columns.This data is pretty much stored backwards.The observation of rider count is being made each month for differnt transit types.The month is the observation unique key and should be a column value.The mode of transportation could be a variable and be in one column or it could be spread and have one column per type

#### mbta3 is pre-loaded
```{r}
head(mbta3)
View(mbta3)
```
Gather columns of mbta3
```{r}
mbta4 <- gather(mbta3, month, thou_riders, -mode)
```
```{r}
head(mbta4)
```
![put head mbta4](https://github.com/venusrohilla/Data-Cleaning/blob/master/Ticket%20Sales/plots/head%20mbta%204.PNG)

#### Coerce thou_riders to numeric
```{r}
mbta4$thou_riders <- as.numeric(mbta4$thou_riders)
head(mbta4)
```
![put mbta 4 part2](https://github.com/venusrohilla/Data-Cleaning/blob/master/Ticket%20Sales/plots/head%20mbta%204%20part2.PNG)

Earlier we had thou_riders as chr type but now they are numeric.
Variables are stored in both rows and columns.Here they want to spread all the modes of transportaion into separate columns
I actually like it in a column for these reasons.I think of the variables as month, trasportation mode, and rider count.
If doing a group by and summarize it needs to be in a column to group by type.Also ggplot will require it in a column
But The exercise is to spread it out.But its not a big deal. Its easy to gather or spread this info based on whats needed for analysis.

#### tidyr is pre-loaded
```{r}
library(tidyr)
```
##### Spread the contents of mbta4
```{r}
mbta5 <- spread(mbta4, mode, thou_riders)
```
```{r}
head(mbta5)
```
![put head mbta5](https://github.com/venusrohilla/Data-Cleaning/blob/master/Ticket%20Sales/plots/head%20mbta%205.PNG)

### Separating columns

Split month column into month and year
```{r}
mbta6 <- separate(mbta5, month, c('year', 'month'))
head(mbta6)
```
![put](https://github.com/venusrohilla/Data-Cleaning/blob/master/Ticket%20Sales/plots/head%20mbta%206.PNG)

plotting a histogram gives a clear view to this.
```{r}
hist(mbta6$Boat)
```
![put mbta boat hist 1](https://github.com/venusrohilla/Data-Cleaning/blob/master/Ticket%20Sales/plots/mbta%20boat%20hist%201.png)

#### Dealing with entry error

Find the row number of the incorrect value: i
```{r}
i <- which(mbta6$Boat == 40)
```
Replace the incorrect value with 4
```{r}
mbta6$Boat[i] <- 4
```
Generate a histogram of Boat column
```{r}
hist(mbta6$Boat)
```
