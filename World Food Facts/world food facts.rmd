# World Food Facts

#### Importing the data
#### Load data.table
```{r}
library(data.table)
```
#### Import food.csv: 
```{r}
url_food <- 'http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1294/datasets/food.csv'
food <- read(url_food)
```
#### Convert food to a data frame
```{r}
food <- data.frame(food)
```
Examining the data
#### View a glimpse of food
```{r}
glimpse(food)
```
![put glimpse part1,2,3](https://github.com/venusrohilla/Data-Cleaning/blob/master/Ticket%20Sales/plots/glimpse%20foodpart1.PNG)
![put](https://github.com/venusrohilla/Data-Cleaning/blob/master/Ticket%20Sales/plots/glimpse%20food%20part2.PNG)
![put](https://github.com/venusrohilla/Data-Cleaning/blob/master/Ticket%20Sales/plots/glimpse%20food%20part3.PNG)

View column names of food

```{r}
names(food)
```
![put foodnames1,2](https://github.com/venusrohilla/Data-Cleaning/blob/master/Ticket%20Sales/plots/food%20names%201.PNG)
![put](https://github.com/venusrohilla/Data-Cleaning/blob/master/Ticket%20Sales/plots/food%20names2.PNG)

We want to limit our output.View structure of food.
```{r}
str(food[,1:10])
```
![put str food](https://github.com/venusrohilla/Data-Cleaning/blob/master/Ticket%20Sales/plots/str%20food.PNG)

#### Removing dupicate info

Define vector of duplicate cols (don't change)
```{r}
duplicates <- c(4, 6, 11, 13, 15, 17, 18, 20, 22, 
                24, 25, 28, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 
                44, 46, 48, 51, 54, 65, 158)
 ```               
                
Remove duplicates from food: 
```{r}
food2 <- food[,-duplicates]
```
### Removing useless info
Define useless vector (don't change)
```{r}
useless <- c(1, 2, 3, 32:41)
```
Remove useless columns from food2: 
```{r}
food3 <- food2[,-useless]
```
#### Finding columns
 Create vector of column indices: nutrition:
 ```{r}
nutrition <- str_detect(names(food3),"100g")
```
View a summary of nutrition columns
```{r}
summary(food3[,nutrition])
```
![put summary food ](https://github.com/venusrohilla/Data-Cleaning/blob/master/Ticket%20Sales/plots/summary%20food%203%20nutri.PNG)
![put](https://github.com/venusrohilla/Data-Cleaning/blob/master/Ticket%20Sales/plots/summary%20food%203%20nutri2.PNG)

As we can see there are lot of missing values. So Replacing missing values:

 Find indices of sugar NA values:
 ```{r}
missing <- is.na(food3$sugars_100g)
```
Replace NA values with 0
```{r}
food3$sugars_100g[missing] <- 0
```
Create first histogram
```{r}
hist(food3$sugars_100g, breaks=100)
```
![put food sugar hist](https://github.com/venusrohilla/Data-Cleaning/blob/master/Ticket%20Sales/plots/food%20sugar%20hist.png)

Create food4
```{r}
food4 <- food3[food3$sugars_100g != 0, ]
```
Create second histogram:
```{r}
hist(food4$sugars_100g, breaks=100)
```
![put food hist 4](https://github.com/venusrohilla/Data-Cleaning/blob/master/Ticket%20Sales/plots/food%20hist%204.png)

### Dealing with messy data
This exercise is attempting to estimate the number of food items in plastic packaging.
Going back to the original food dataframe here.packagin_tags column was removed in an earlier exercise. 

Find entries containing "plastic": 
```{r}
plastic <- str_detect(food$packaging_tags,"plasti")
sum(plastic)
```
