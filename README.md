# Data-Cleaning 
I referred the following resources for understanding the Data Cleaning Process:
* [Introduction_to_data_cleaning_with_R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/de_Jonge+van_der_Loo-Introduction_to_data_cleaning_with_R.pdf)
* [DataCamp Course on Data Cleaning](https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/an-introduction-to-cleaning-data-in-r)

##### Data cleaning is an essential part of the data science process. In simple terms, this process might break down into four steps: collecting or acquiring your data, cleaning your data, analyzing or modeling your data, and reporting your results to the appropriate audience. If you try to skip the second step, you'll often run into problems getting the raw data to work with traditional tools for analysis in, say, R . This could be true for a variety of reasons. For example, many common algorithms require variables to be arranged into columns and for missing values to be either removed or replaced with non-missing values.
##### Not only is data cleaning an essential part of the data science process - it's also often the most time-consuming part. As the New York Times reported in a 2014 article called "For Big-Data Scientists, ‘Janitor Work’ Is Key Hurdle to Insights", "Data scientists ... spend from 50 percent to 80 percent of their time mired in this more mundane labor of collecting and preparing unruly digital data, before it can be explored for useful nuggets."
##### In this project I have worked on three datasets namely:
* Ticket Sales Data available [at this link](http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1294/datasets/sales.csv).
* MBTA Ridership Data (I have uploaded the dataset).
* World Food Facts which can be [downloaded from here](http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1294/datasets/food.csv).
