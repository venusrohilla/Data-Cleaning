```{r}
getwd()
Loading the sales data from the link 
url_sales<-'http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1294/datasets/sales.csv'
Reading the data into sales
sales <- read.csv(url_sales, stringsAsFactors=F)
```
```{r}
dim(sales)
```
![put sales dim image](https://github.com/venusrohilla/Data-Cleaning/blob/master/Ticket%20Sales/plots/sales%20dim.PNG)

the number of rows are 5000 and no. of variables are 46

for seeing the first six  starting rows and columns 

```{r}
head(sales)
summary(sales)
```
![put image](https://github.com/venusrohilla/Data-Cleaning/blob/master/Ticket%20Sales/plots/sales%20summary%20part1.PNG)

![put image](https://github.com/venusrohilla/Data-Cleaning/blob/master/Ticket%20Sales/plots/sales%20summary%20part2.PNG)

#### for finding the columns name

```{r}
names(sales)
```
![put names image](https://github.com/venusrohilla/Data-Cleaning/blob/master/Ticket%20Sales/plots/names%20image.PNG)

there are 46 columns with the above names
the str function gives a good understanding of what our data type is .ie is it character ,or integer

```{r}
str(sales)
```
![put str part1,2 image](https://github.com/venusrohilla/Data-Cleaning/blob/master/Ticket%20Sales/plots/str%20part1.PNG)

![put image](https://github.com/venusrohilla/Data-Cleaning/blob/master/Ticket%20Sales/plots/str%20part2.PNG)

```{r}
library(dplyr)
glimpse(sales)
```
#### the glimpse function is similar to str function but gives us more clear  view the data type.

![put glimpse part1,2](https://github.com/venusrohilla/Data-Cleaning/blob/master/Ticket%20Sales/plots/glimpse%20part1.PNG)

![put](https://github.com/venusrohilla/Data-Cleaning/blob/master/Ticket%20Sales/plots/glimpse%20part2.PNG)

as we can see the difference, in the out put of str the age_yr had NA vales while in the output of glimpse func we can see the null 
value as well as the numeric values also.

#### removing the first col of sales
```{r}
sales2<-sales[,-1]
str(sales2)
ncol(sales2)
```
![put ncol sales2 image](https://github.com/venusrohilla/Data-Cleaning/blob/master/Ticket%20Sales/plots/ncol%20sales2.PNG)

#### removing not much required information
removing first 4 columns or the last 15

```{r}
keep<- seq(5,ncol(sales2)-15,1)
keep
```
![put keep sales2 image](https://github.com/venusrohilla/Data-Cleaning/blob/master/Ticket%20Sales/plots/keep%20sales2.PNG)

#### Subset sales2 using keep: sales3
```{r}
sales3<-sales2[,keep]
glimpse(sales3)
```
![put glimpsesales 3](https://github.com/venusrohilla/Data-Cleaning/blob/master/Ticket%20Sales/plots/glimpse%20sales%203.PNG)

as we can see the first 4 col and the last 15 col are reemoved

#### Split event_date_time: sales4
```{r}
library(tidyr)
library(stringr)
head(sales3$event_date_time)
```
![put sales3 event date time](https://github.com/venusrohilla/Data-Cleaning/blob/master/Ticket%20Sales/plots/sales3%20event%20date%20time.PNG)
we can see the date and time are writen together so we need to separate it.

```{r}
sales4 <- separate(sales3, event_date_time, c('event_dt', 'event_time'), sep = " ")
```
#### check new columns
```{r}
col <- str_detect(names(sales4),'event')
glimpse(sales4[,col])
```
![putsepareted date time event](https://github.com/venusrohilla/Data-Cleaning/blob/master/Ticket%20Sales/plots/separeted%20date%20time%20event.PNG)
